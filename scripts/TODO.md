# To-do list
- [ ] Automatically change `SimMode` for `cv_*.py` files (and also restore it)
- [ ] Use longer (more descriptive) names for the files under `scripts/`
- [ ] Only choose the first environment (when there's more than one possibility) if a flag `--choose` is passed
  - [ ] Add an argument so that `$ ... --launch --choose 2` starts the second environment from the list
